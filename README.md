## Python Basics Mini Project

This mini project is a guided tour of core Python concepts. Each lesson contains a short explanation, example code, and suggested experiments so you can learn by running and modifying the files yourself.

### How to Use This Project
- Ensure Python 3 is installed (`python3 --version`).
- Run any lesson with `python3 lessons/01_variables.py`.
- Read the comments and printed output, then try the "Your turn" prompts at the bottom of each file.

### Lesson Overview

#### Basics (Start Here)
1. **Variables & Data Types** – creating variables, basic arithmetic, and string formatting.
2. **Input & Conditionals** – reading user input and reacting with `if/elif/else`.
3. **Loops** – repeating work with `for` and `while`.
4. **Functions** – packaging logic into reusable blocks.
5. **Mini Project** – a simple number guessing game that combines everything above.

#### Advanced Topics
6. **Lists & Dictionaries** – working with collections and key-value pairs.
7. **List Comprehensions** – concise and Pythonic way to create lists.
8. **File Handling** – reading from and writing to files, working with JSON.
9. **Error Handling** – using try/except to handle errors gracefully.
10. **Classes & OOP** – object-oriented programming with classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
11. **Modules & Packages** – organizing code and using Python's standard library.
12. **Advanced Project** – a task manager application combining all concepts.

#### API & Web Lessons
13. **API Client Basics** – step-by-step guide to calling REST APIs with `requests`.
14. **Build a Flask API** – create your own REST endpoints with Flask.
15. **FastAPI Basics** – modern, fast API framework with automatic documentation and type validation.
16. **FastAPI Advanced** – async/await, dependencies, middleware, authentication, and background tasks.

### Learning Path
- **Beginners**: Start with lessons 1-5 to build a solid foundation.
- **Intermediate**: Move to lessons 6-9 to expand your skills.
- **Advanced**: Complete lessons 10-12 to master Python concepts.
- **API Ready**: Tackle lessons 13-16 once you're comfortable with the basics.

> Tip: Install extra dependencies once before running the API lessons:
> - For API client: `python3 -m pip install requests`
> - For Flask: `python3 -m pip install flask`
> - For FastAPI: `python3 -m pip install fastapi uvicorn`

Feel free to edit or extend any file; breaking things is part of learning!
